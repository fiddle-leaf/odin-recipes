<h2>My favorite Shrimp Scampi recipe so far!</h2>

<p>
    I like to turn Shrimp Scampi into a pasta dish, because why not? A lot of pasta dishes can be super heavy, but, rest assured, this one shall not be. It is light and easy.

    I used this recipe from Cafe Delites with a twist. I make it as easy as possible to prepare. Let's get started!

    <li>red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>lemon juice</li>

<ol>
    <li>Start by cooking your noodles. Bring six cups of water to a boil and cook your noodles al dente.</li>
